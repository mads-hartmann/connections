# Connections

This is my attempt at building this:

> I want this weird hybrid of an app that's somewhere between an RSS reader and a Contacts app. I want to be able to organise my social graph and also snoop in on everyone and what they're up to.

It's currently very rough, and I'm mostly building it as an exercise to see how good Ona is at building OCaml apps and trying to push my own limits when it comes to vibe ~~coding~~ engineering.
